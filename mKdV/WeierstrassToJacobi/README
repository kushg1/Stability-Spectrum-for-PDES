This folder contains all of the files necessary to compute the Jacobi Elliptic
SN^2 function from the Weierstrass P function. 

The .csv files, 'auxiliaryOutputTable.' and 'snSquaredOutputTable.' are for
testing.

'auxiliaryOutputTable.' has output of the form {g2, g3, e1, e2, e3, omega1,
omega3, k} for g2 in range(1,1.5,0.1) and g3 in range(-0.5,0.5,0.1). It should
be used for testing these auxiliary quantities needed to compute SN^2. 
ALL NUMERICAL VALUES ARE ROUNDED TO 10^(-10), SO YOU SHOULD CHECK WHETHER OR
NOT YOUR OUTPUT AGREES ONLY UP TO THAT ACCURACY OR LOWER.

'snSquaredOutputTable.' has output of the form {g2, g3, x, OUTPUT} where
OUTPUT is the expression of the WeierstrassEllipticP function in terms of
jacobi elliptic SN function, g2 in range(1,1.5,0.1), g3 in range(-0.5,0.5,0.1)
and x in range(1,3,0.1).
ALL NUMERICAL VALUES ARE ROUNDED TO 10^(-10), SO YOU SHOULD CHECK WHETHER OR
NOT YOUR OUTPUT AGREES ONLY UP TO THAT ACCURACY OR LOWER.

The .nb file 'testsForWeierstrassToJacobi.' shows how I do this using
Mathematica (which has its own built-in and nice algorithms). It can only be
run on v11.3 and higher.
